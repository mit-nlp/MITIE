MITIE: MIT Information Extraction [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wihoho/MITIE.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wihoho/MITIE)
=====

This project provides free (even for commercial use)
[state-of-the-art](../../wiki/Evaluation) information extraction
tools. The current release includes tools for performing [named entity
extraction](http://blog.dlib.net/2014/04/mitie-completely-free-and-state-of-art.html) 
and [binary relation detection](http://blog.dlib.net/2014/07/mitie-v02-released-now-includes-python.html) 
as well as tools for training custom extractors and relation detectors.  

MITIE comes with trained models for English and Spanish.  The English named entity recognition model is 
trained based on data from the English Gigaword news corpus, the CoNLL 2003 named entity recognition task,
and ACE data.  The Spanish model is based on the Spanish Gigaword corpus and CoNLL 2002 named entity 
recognition task.  There are also 21 English binary relation extraction models provided which
were trained on a 
[combination of Wikipedia and Freebase data](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mitie/files/freebase_wikipedia_binary_relation_training_data_v1.0.tar.bz2/download).

Additionally, the core library provides APIs in C, C++, Java, R, and Python 2.7.  Outside
projects have created bindings for [OCaml](https://github.com/travisbrady/omitie) and 
[.NET](https://github.com/BayardRock/MITIE-Dot-Net).  Future releases will 
add bindings in Java, R, and possibly other languages.

# Using MITIE

MITIE's primary API is a C API which is documented in the
[mitie.h](mitielib/include/mitie.h) header file.  Beyond this, there are many
[example programs](examples/) showing how to use MITIE from C, C++, Java, R, or Python 2.7.

### Initial Setup

Before you can run the provided examples you will need to download the trained
model files which you can do by running:
```
make MITIE-models
```
or by simply downloading the [MITIE-models-v0.2.tar.bz2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mitie/files/binaries/MITIE-models-v0.2.tar.bz2)
file and extracting it in your MITIE folder.  Note that the Spanish models are supplied in 
a separate download.  So if you want to use the Spanish NER model then download [MITIE-models-v0.2-Spanish.zip](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mitie/files/binaries/MITIE-models-v0.2-Spanish.zip) and
extract it into your MITIE folder.

### Using MITIE from the command line

MITIE comes with a basic streaming NER tool.  So you can tell MITIE to
process each line of a text file independently and output marked up text with the command:

```
cat sample_text.txt | ./ner_stream MITIE-models/english/ner_model.dat  
```

The ner_stream executable can be compiled by running `make` in the top level MITIE folder or
by navigating to the [tools/ner_stream](tools/ner_stream) folder and running `make` or using 
CMake to build it which can be done with the following commands:
```
cd tools/ner_stream
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Compiling MITIE as a shared library

On a UNIX like system, this can be accomplished by running `make` in the top level MITIE folder or
by running:
```
cd mitielib
make
```
This produces shared and static library files in the mitielib folder.  Or you can use
CMake to compile a shared library by typing:
```
cd mitielib
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
```

Either of these methods will create a MITIE shared library in the mitielib folder. 

### Compiling MITIE using OpenBLAS

If you compile MITIE using cmake then it will automatically find and use any optimized BLAS
libraries on your machine.  However, if you compile using regular make then you have
to manually locate your BLAS libaries or DLIB will default to its built in, but slower, BLAS
implementation.   Therefore, to use OpenBLAS when compiling without cmake, locate `libopenblas.a` and `libgfortran.a`, then
run `make` as follows:
```
cd mitielib 
make BLAS_PATH=/path/to/openblas.a LIBGFORTRAN_PATH=/path/to/libfortran.a
```
Note that if your BLAS libraries are not in standard locations cmake will fail to find them.  However,
you can tell it what folder to look in by replacing `cmake ..` with a statement such as:
```
cmake -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/me/place/i/put/blas/lib ..
```

### Using MITIE from a Python 2.7 program

Once you have built the MITIE shared library, you can go to the [examples/python](examples/python) folder
and simply run any of the Python scripts.  Each script is a tutorial explaining some aspect of
MITIE: [named entity recognition and relation extraction](examples/python/ner.py), 
[training a custom NER tool](examples/python/train_ner.py), or 
[training a custom relation extractor](examples/python/train_relation_extraction.py).

### Using MITIE from R

MITIE can be installed as an R package. See the [README](tools/R-binding) for more details.

### Using MITIE from a C program

There are example C programs in the [examples/C](examples/C) folder.  To compile of them you simply
go into those folders and run `make`.  Or use CMake like so:
```
cd examples/C/ner
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Using MITIE from a C++ program

There are example C++ programs in the [examples/cpp](examples/cpp) folder.  To compile any of them you simply
go into those folders and run `make`.  Or use CMake like so:
```
cd examples/cpp/ner
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Using MITIE from a Java program

There is an example Java program in the [examples/java](examples/java) folder.  Before you can run it you
must compile MITIE's java interface which you can do like so:
```
cd mitielib/java
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
```
That will place a javamitie shared library and jar file into the mitielib folder.  Once you have those
two files you can run the example program in examples/java by running run_ner.bat if you are on Windows or
run_ner.sh if you are on a POSIX system like Linux or OS X.

Also note that you must have Swig 1.3.40 or newer, CMake 2.8.4 or newer, and the Java JDK installed to compile the MITIE interface.  Finally, note that if you are using 64bit Java on Windows then you will need to use a command like:
```
cmake -G "Visual Studio 10 Win64" ..
```
instead of  `cmake ..` so that Visual Studio knows to make a 64bit library.

### Running MITIE's unit tests

You can run a simple regression test to validate your build.  Do this by running
the following command from the top level MITIE folder:

```
make test
```

`make test` builds both the example programs and downloads required
example models.  If you require a non-standard C++ compiler, change
`CC` in `examples/C/makefile` and in `tools/ner_stream/makefile`.
